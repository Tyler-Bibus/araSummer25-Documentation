While the project was successful, there are areas for future development:

- **Update to a Newer Release:** The patch was developed for srsRAN release 23_10. It should be updated to a more recent version to incorporate the latest features and bug fixes.
- **Finalize ARA Deployment:** The containerized experiments need to be finalized for deployment on the ARA network.
- **Range and Connectivity Testing:** More rigorous testing is needed to determine the exact maximum range and connectivity performance of the outdoor setup

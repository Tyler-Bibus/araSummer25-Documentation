Future Work

There are several areas for future improvement and verification.

- **Incorporate into Official Repository:** Work with the OAI members to incorporate the patch into the official repository.
- **Configuration Validation:** Add verification logic to ensure that the slot choices in the configuration file are valid (e.g., ensuring they fall in a DL or UL slot as appropriate).
- **Thoroughput and Range Testing:** While the HARQ issue was resolved, more thorough throughput and range testing in an outdoor environment is still needed.

A server with a stable IP (*or custom domain*) that we can assign a host domain to

SSH access to all computers we will add to client list, appropriately put into groups

Clients do *not* need stable IPs, as long as they maintain access to the server.

Once we have all clients assigned and in the mender service, we can create artifacts to update software, from OS, to packages, to UHD drivers.
